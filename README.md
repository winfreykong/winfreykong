- 👋 Hello there, I'm Winfrey. Welcome to my crib!
- 🌱 This is where I document my growth and where I find my motivation as I pave my way to become a software/data engineer in year 2024.
- 💞️ Maybe one day, I will be able to help and inspire other people through this channel. More importantly, this is where I start, where I learn and where I grow infinitely.
- 🎢 A reminder to self: Enjoy the rollercoaster ride! Stay excited throughout the rise and laugh through the fall
